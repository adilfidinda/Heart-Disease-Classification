# Heart Disease Classification

## Background and Problems
Heart disease or often referred to as cardiovascular disease is a term to describe various conditions or disorders of the heart, be it coronary artery disorders, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias), heart defects from birth or chest pain (angina). Heart disease is one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Data from WHO (World Health Organization) shows that this disease is the leading cause of global death where as many as 17.9 million people die each year. Thus, efforts to prevent heart disease are needed. A good database system can be used to predict heart disease. These predictions can be used to improve the research and prevention process so that it can help ensure more people can live healthy lives and avoid the risk of developing heart disease.

## Object
The classification of risk for heart disease is determined based on several variables from medical data.

## Goals
Classify risk for heart disease for better prevention
